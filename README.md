*INTERN ID*: CT12WNHE

*DOMAIN*: DATA ANALYTICS

*DURATION*: 12 WEEKS

*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTOSH

*DESCRIPTION*: Predictive analysis is a data-driven approach that utilizes machine learning techniques to forecast future outcomes based on historical data. In this project, we build a regression model to predict cricket player performance, specifically Runs Scored, using features such as Matches Batted, Not Outs, Balls Faced, Batting Strike Rate, Centuries, and Sixes.

The dataset contains player statistics but includes missing values and inconsistencies like "No stats," which must be handled through data cleaning. After preprocessing, we select relevant features and split the data into training and testing sets. A Linear Regression model is used to establish a relationship between input features and the target variable.

Once trained, the model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score. A low MSE and a high R² score (0.997 in this case) indicate that the model accurately predicts the number of runs a player might score.

This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in sports analytics, helping teams and analysts predict player performance, optimize team selection, and strategize effectively. Future improvements could involve advanced models like Random Forests or Neural Networks for enhanced accuracy.
